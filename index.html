      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
        and Economics @ Seoul National University, and an incoming D.D.S. student at the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University.
        My academic training emphasizes analytical thinking, data-driven reasoning, and evidence-based decision making,
        which I aim to apply to the field of dentistry.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research experience spans biomedical data analysis, digital health technologies, and preventive
        dental research. I am particularly interested in how quantitative analysis and system-level thinking can be
        translated into preventive strategies and equitable healthcare delivery in dentistry.

        <em>An epidemiological trend analysis of oral cancer in Korea from 2001 to 2021.</em><br/>
        BMC Oral Health (SCIE), 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        This nationwide epidemiological study analyzed 20 years of oral cancer incidence and mortality data
        from the Korean National Cancer Registry. I contributed to data visualization, statistical analysis,
        and figure development, with a focus on age, sex, and subsite-specific trends in oral cancer.
        The study identified a marked increase in oral cancer incidence among younger females and highlighted
        evolving disease patterns relevant to prevention and early detection strategies.

      <h2>Dental & Oral Health Research</h2>

      <p><strong>Disparities in Access to Dental Sealants Among People with Disabilities in Korea</strong></p>
      <p>
        I conducted a nationwide population-based analysis using National Health Insurance Service claims data
        from 2013 to 2023 to evaluate disparities in access to dental sealants among children and adolescents
        with disabilities. The study quantified preventive care utilization using procedure codes for disabled
        and non-disabled populations and examined differences by disability status, gender, and region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis revealed persistently lower sealant utilization among individuals with disabilities,
        with disabled females accessing preventive care at substantially lower rates than disabled males.
        Significant regional disparities were also observed, with markedly reduced access outside the capital
        metropolitan area. These findings underscore structural inequities in preventive dentistry and support
        the need for targeted public health and policy interventions for vulnerable populations.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Digital Oral Health Management for Elderly Populations</strong></p>
      <p>
        In collaboration with the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, I developed a digital oral
        health management application for elderly users integrating validated self-assessment tools
        (GOHAI, OHSE-K). The system was designed to support preventive oral healthcare through usability-focused
        design, personalized feedback, and structured self-monitoring, with an emphasis on accessibility and
        health literacy.

      <p><strong>Glioma cfDNA Classification</strong> (2024–2025)</p>
      <p>
        At the Biophotonics and Nano Engineering Lab, Seoul National University, I developed a deep learning–based
        pipeline to enhance detection of glioma cell-free DNA from RRBS methylation data.
        The project addressed extreme class imbalance and low signal-to-noise conditions by integrating
        Bis-SNP–based SNV labeling and downstream model refinement, demonstrating the applicability of
        computational methods to translational biomedical research.
