      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
        and Economics, and an incoming D.D.S. student at the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University.
        My academic training emphasizes analytical thinking, data-driven reasoning, and evidence-based decision making,
        which I aim to apply to dentistry and public health.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research experience includes biomedical data analysis, where I developed a deep learning pipeline to enhance
        detection of glioma cell-free DNA from RRBS methylation data. In parallel, I have worked on a digital oral health
        management application for elderly users in collaboration with the School of Dentistry, focusing on usability and
        preventive care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Broadly, I am interested in how technology, data, and systems thinking can improve healthcare delivery,
        accessibility, and clinical outcomes.
