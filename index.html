      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
        and Economics, and an incoming D.D.S. student at the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University.
        My academic training emphasizes analytical thinking, data-driven reasoning, and evidence-based decision making,
        which I aim to apply to dentistry and public health.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research experience spans biomedical data analysis, digital health technologies, and public health–oriented
        applications. I am particularly interested in how computational methods and human-centered system design can
        support preventive care, improve accessibility, and enhance clinical decision making in dentistry.
