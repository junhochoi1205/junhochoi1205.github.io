        </p>

        <p>
          I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
          and Economics, and an incoming D.D.S. student at the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University.
          My background combines analytical engineering training with a strong interest in healthcare, public health,
          and data-driven clinical decision making.
        </p>

        <p>
          My research experience includes biomedical data analysis, where I worked on a deep learning pipeline to enhance
          detection of glioma cell-free DNA from RRBS methylation data, as well as the development of a digital oral health
          management application for elderly users in collaboration with the School of Dentistry.
          These experiences shaped my interest in patient-centered and preventive dentistry supported by technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Broadly, I am interested in how data, systems thinking, and technology can be applied to improve healthcare
          delivery, accessibility, and clinical outcomes.
        </p>
