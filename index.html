    <!-- About Me -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Economics,
        and an incoming D.D.S. student at the School of Dentistry, Seoul National University.
        My academic background has trained me to approach problems analytically, with a strong foundation in data analysis,
        systems thinking, and evidence-based decision making.
        Through research in biomedical data analysis, I worked on a deep learning pipeline to enhance detection of glioma
        cell-free DNA from RRBS methylation data.
        I have also developed a digital oral health management application for elderly users in collaboration with the
        School of Dentistry, focusing on usability and preventive care.
        These experiences shaped my interest in applying technology to healthcare, particularly in patient-centered and
        preventive dentistry.
        Beyond academics, leadership roles in student government and technical writing refined my ability to communicate
        across disciplines.
        I aim to pursue dentistry with a strong emphasis on technology and data-driven clinical practice.
